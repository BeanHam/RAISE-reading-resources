## Spatial Disaggregation
- **(2019)** [A spatial regression model for the disaggregation of areal unit based data to high-resolution grids with application to vaccination coverage mapping](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0962280218797362)
  - **Abstract** This paper develops a methodology for high-resolution mapping of vaccination coverage using areal data in settings where point-referenced survey data are inaccessible.
  - **Model** Bayesian model: binomial spatial regression model with a logit link and a combination of covariate data and random effects modelling two levels of spatial autocorrelation in the linear predictor. The Bayesian model is fitted using the INLA-SPDE approach.
  - **Data**: DHS surveys from 2013 and 2015 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Aggregated data at administrative level.

  - **Model** dasymetric method + grid census population into fine-resolution using 3d building information
  - **Data**: population data; building information; aerial images
