  - **Abstract** This paper develops a methodology for high-resolution mapping of vaccination coverage using areal data in settings where point-referenced survey data are inaccessible.
  - **Model** Bayesian model: binomial spatial regression model with a logit link and a combination of covariate data and random effects modelling two levels of spatial autocorrelation in the linear predictor. The Bayesian model is fitted using the INLA-SPDE approach.
  - **Data**: DHS surveys from 2013 and 2015 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Aggregated data at administrative level.
